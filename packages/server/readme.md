Apollo Server is a community-maintained open-source GraphQL server. It works with pretty much all Node.js HTTP server frameworks, and we're happy to take PRs for more! Apollo Server works with any GraphQL schema built with [GraphQL.js](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js), so you can build your schema with that directly or with a convenience library such as [graphql-tools](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphql-tools/).

## Documentation

## Principles

Apollo Server is built with the following principles in mind:

* **By the community, for the community**: Apollo Server's development is driven by the needs of developers
* **Simplicity**: by keeping things simple, Apollo Server is easier to use, easier to contribute to, and more secure
* **Performance**: Apollo Server is well-tested and production-ready - no modifications needed
